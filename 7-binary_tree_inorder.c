/**
 * binary_tree_inorder - Goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
 * @tree: Pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse
 * @func: Pointer to a function to call for each node
 *
 * Description: This function traverses a binary tree using in-order traversal,
 * meaning it processes the current node between its left and right children.
 * It takes a function pointer as an argument, which is called for each node,
 * and the value in the node is passed as a parameter to this function.
 * If tree or func is NULL, the function does nothing.
